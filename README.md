PRotos-enhancement
==================

Trying to improve my GRRF PRotos V2

I was pretty annoyed by the crapy original x-axis mount of GRRF PRotos V2. As I wanted to change the poor extruder and hotend anyway I decided to go all the way and give the new x-axis of RepRapPro Mendel a workover to fit the PRotos. You can find the instruction on how to mount the Mendel x-axis here: http://www.reprappro.com/documentation/RepRapPro_Tricolour_x_axis_assembly

Please note:
As of now this is still work in progress! If finally working I will update this desciption accordingly.
Feel free to use this design but remember the GPL! If you use and alter, you have to share again.
Feedback on this is highly appreciated! ;)

Regards
Florian
